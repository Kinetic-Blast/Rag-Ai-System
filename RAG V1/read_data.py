    "Query: What are the benefits of regular exercise?\n"
    "Answer: Regular exercise offers numerous benefits for both physical and mental health. It improves cardiovascular health by strengthening the heart and reducing the risk of hypertension. It also helps maintain a healthy weight by burning calories and boosting metabolism. Additionally, exercise enhances mental well-being by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood boosters. Over time, regular physical activity can improve muscle tone, increase flexibility, and promote better sleep, contributing to overall vitality. Exercise isn't just about physical health, it has positive effects on mental health too. Moreover, by developing a regular exercise routine, one can significantly reduce the risks of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.\n"
    
    "\nExample 2:\n"
    "Query: What is the significance of cybersecurity in modern businesses?\n"
    "Answer: Cybersecurity is crucial for protecting a business's data, reputation, and financial assets. In today's digital age, businesses rely heavily on technology, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Effective cybersecurity measures safeguard sensitive customer information, such as personal data and payment details, from theft. Moreover, robust security practices ensure the integrity of business operations, preventing disruptions caused by data breaches, ransomware, or other malicious activities. A business's commitment to cybersecurity helps maintain customer trust, ensures compliance with regulations, and avoids costly disruptions that could harm its reputation. In addition, modern cybersecurity involves not just protecting data but also ensuring that businesses are ready to respond to threats in real-time, reducing downtime and preventing long-term damage.\n"
